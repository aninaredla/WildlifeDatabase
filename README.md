# WildlifeDatabase
SQL Code that reflects the design and implementation of a database, along with intermediate SQL querying examples to gain informational insights.

## Project Objective
Here, I used concepts of ERD modeling and LDM modeling to plan and design a database for a Wildlife Conservation Center. 
I also use intermediate-level SQL querying to extract relevant insights from this relational database.
